Business Gathering
First I read the given information carfeully l, then I tried to search google for " huge cyber security conference ".
I found a website which lists 8 of cyber security confrences with their details https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/8-cybersecurity-conferences-to-attend
I seached with the location and I found San Francisco in the second conference.
finally I took its name and it worked.

Hidden Message
After visiting the link it opens to a page containing only one single image, after trying to inspect the page I found nothing helpful.
So, I downloaded the image then opened it with exiftool to see its information.
I found something weird in the the Copyright Notice, I took it to hash analyzer https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/ and it said that it was MD5, exactly as cyber talents said.
I submitted it, and it works.
